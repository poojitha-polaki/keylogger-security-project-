🔐 Keylogger GUI – Cybersecurity Internship Project

This is a simple GUI-based Keylogger tool. The project was designed for *ethical hacking awareness* and to understand *keystroke capturing techniques* and *input vulnerabilities*.

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 Captures *Pressed*, *Held*, and *Released* keys
- 💾 Saves logs in both *TXT* and *JSON* format
- 🖥 Built with *Tkinter* for a simple GUI (Start/Stop functionality)
- 🔐 Developed in *Kali Linux* to simulate security scenarios

## 🛠 Technologies Used

| Tool         | Purpose                          |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| Python       | Main programming language        |
| pynput       | Capturing keyboard events        |
| Tkinter      | Building GUI                     |
| JSON Module  | Logging key events in JSON       |
| Kali Linux   | Ethical hacking environment      |

## 📂 Output Files

- key_log.txt – Plain text record of all keystrokes  
- key_log.json – Structured log with pressed, held, released key events

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Launch the app using python keylogger.py
2. Click *Start* → Keylogging begins  
3. Keyboard inputs are captured in background  
4. Click *Stop* → Listener stops and file logging ends
